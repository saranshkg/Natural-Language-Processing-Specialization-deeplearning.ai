C2_W2: Part of Speech Tagging and Hidden Markov Models
Learn about Markov chains and Hidden Markov models, then use them to create part-of-speech tags for a Wall Street Journal text corpus!

Key Concepts:
    Markov chains
    Hidden Markov models
    Part-of-speech tagging
    Viterbi algorithm
    Transition probabilities
    Emission probabilities

Lecture Labs:
	Lecture Lab 1: Working with text data
	Instructions: In this lecture notebook you will create a vocabulary out of a corpus, learn how to handle words that don't appear within that vocabulary and work with text data in general.

	Lecture Lab 2: Working with text data
	Instructions: In this lecture notebook you will be working with Numpy for matrix creation and manipulation. You will populate a matrix with some information about tags and learn different approaches when using Numpy such as vectorization.
