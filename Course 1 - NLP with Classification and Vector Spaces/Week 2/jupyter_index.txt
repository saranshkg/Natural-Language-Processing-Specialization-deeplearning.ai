C1_W2: Sentiment Analysis with Na√Øve Bayes
Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier of your own!

Key Concepts:
    Error analysis
    Naive Bayes inference
    Log likelihood
    Laplacian smoothing
    conditional probabilities
    Bayes rule
    Sentiment analysis
    Vocabulary creation
    Supervised learning

Lecture Labs:
	Lecture Lab 1: Visualizing likelihoods and confidence ellipses
	Instructions: Please go through this lecture notebook about visualizing likelihoods of tweets and the confidence ellipses for annotated  corpuses. The positive and negative likelihoods of a tweet can be interpreted as a pair of numerical features  extracted from raw text. The visual inspection of the features that will feed a model allows to better understand the problem.
