C1_W4: Machine Translation and Document Search
Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.

Key Concepts:
    Gradient descent
    Approximate nearest neighbors
    Locality sensitive hashing
    Hash functions
    Hash tables
    K nearest neighbors
    Document search
    Machine translation
    Frobenius norm

Lecture Labs:
	Lecture Lab 1: Rotation matrices in R2
	Instructions: In this ungraded notebook, you'll practice advance vector transformation in Python. Specifically, you will define and use rotation matrices and plot vectors using pyplot.

	Lecture Lab 2: Hash tables
	Instructions: Hash tables are data structures based on dictionaries that allows to index data in order to improve heavy lookup tasks. In this notebook, you will have the opportunity to see the details of the implementation of these tables.
