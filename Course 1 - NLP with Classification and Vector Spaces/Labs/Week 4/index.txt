Lab: Rotation matrices in R2
Instructions: In this ungraded notebook, you'll practice advance vector transformation in Python. Specifically, you will define and use rotation matrices and plot vectors using pyplot.

Lab: Hash tables
Instructions: Hash tables are data structures based on dictionaries that allows to index data in order to improve heavy lookup tasks. In this notebook, you will have the opportunity to see the details of the implementation of these tables.
